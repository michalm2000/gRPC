I dreamed I rolled on the ocean floor
In the sunken bones of a broken ship
On the shadow line where whispers creep
To the world above from the world beneath
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
'Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives
I dreamed of the moment of my own death
That no one ever dreams and lives
I dreamed I sailed to the mirrored edge
Of the murky world for an iron bell
That dragged me down to the ocean depths
And rang to mark where my shadow fell
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
'Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives
I dreamed of the moment of my own death
No one ever dreams and lives
No one ever dreams and lives
No one ever dreams and lives
I dreamed I slept on the ocean bed
In a silent grave of silver sand
Rolled in the sway of an iron bell
I've heard it said when they go to sea
On stormy nights you can hear her moan
She tolls for the mourning of my own death
And echoes here on the village stones
I dreamed of silver I dreamed of gold
I dreamed of the moment of my own death
That no one ever dreams and lives
No one ever dreams and lives
No one ever dreams and lives
